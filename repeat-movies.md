A list of movies I enjoy watching over and over again. If I come across one of 
these anywhere, I'm likely to watch it to its conclusion if I have the time. They are 
also good to have on while working on something else, as they do not require my full 
or consistent attention. And they are also great if sick in bed for the same reason. 
They are movies I like, or love, but not all movies that are truly great. They are
my personal classics, I guess.

There are more. There are always more. I'll add to the list as I think of them.
